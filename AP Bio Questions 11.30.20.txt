In response to elevated blood glucose levels, beta (β) cells in the pancreas release insulin, a regulatory hormone. Insulin signals body cells to take up glucose from the blood, which returns blood glucose levels back to normal. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that destroys β-cells, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels.
Researchers have proposed that diabetes could be treated by implanting human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that have been induced to develop into β-cells (hESC-β). To test the proposed treatment, the researchers set up two groups of genetically identical mice and implanted the mice from one group with hESC-β cells. Several weeks after the hESC-β implant, both groups of mice were given a drug (STZ) that selectively destroys the naturally occurring mouse β-cells but does not affect the implanted hESC-β cells. Figure 1 shows a comparison of average blood glucose levels in both groups of mice.

a
Figure 1 shows the events during and immediately following fertilization of a sea urchin egg. Sexual
reproduction relies on the successful fusion of only one sperm with one egg (time 1) during fertilization.
In sea urchins, a diploid organism, several events prevent additional sperm from fertilizing the egg.
One of the first events following fertilization is the fusion of secretory vesicles called cortical granules
with the egg plasma membrane (time 2). The cortical granules release their contents, a mixture of
polysaccharides and proteins, into the perivitelline space. Subsequent to this, water moves into the
perivitelline space, causing it to expand and physically separate the fertilization envelope from the egg
plasma membrane (time 3). The fertilization envelope prevents fusion of more than one sperm with the
egg.
(a) Provide ONE reason that preventing fusion of multiple sperm with one egg in sea urchins has
provided a survival advantage over evolutionary time. (1 point)
(b) Describe how the release of the contents of the cortical granules into the perivitelline space

pH. Which of the following best describes the physiological response to an overall increase in cellular

respiration in the body?

diaphragm, resulting in an increased rate of breathing to help eliminate excess blood CO2 .

Two competing hypotheses exist regarding the cell membrane structure. One hypothesis states that membrane structure is static and membrane components throughout the bilayer are rigidly bound. Alternatively, the other hypothesis states that cell membranes are a fluid mosaic in which membrane components may drift within the bilayer around the surface of the cell.

The membrane of each dialysis bag membrane contains pores that allow small solutes such as monoatomic ions to pass through but are too small for anything larger to pass. After 30 minutes, 5 mL of a concentrated solution of albumin (a medium-sized, water-soluble protein) is added to one of the two beakers. Nothing is added to the other beaker.

Certain bacteria can use both ethyl alcohol and acetate as sources of nutrients. In an experiment where both nutrients are available to a bacterial population, the following results were obtained and graphed.
What additional procedure would best help determine whether these movements are due to active transport or to passive transport?
Use two additional treatments, one containing only ethyl alcohol and one containing only acetate. Include a substance known to block ATP use by the plasma membrane. Compare the graphs of these two treatments to the original graph.
Active transport requires the availability of ATP. If the nutrients are actively transported, blocking ATP use should reduce the rate of transport along the whole concentration range. If these two graphs are the same as the original graph, the transport is passive. Separation of the nutrients eliminates the possibility that the two transport processes could interfere with each other.
